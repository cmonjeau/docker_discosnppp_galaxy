### DiscoSNP++ description ###

Software discoSnp is designed for discovering Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) from raw set(s) of reads obtained with Next Generation Sequencers (NGS).
Note that number of input read sets is not constrained, it can be one, two, or more. Note also that no other data as reference genome or annotations are needed.
The software is composed by two modules. First module, kissnp2, detects SNPs from read sets. A second module, kissreads, enhance the kissnp2 results by computing per read set  and for each found SNP i/ its mean read coverage and ii/ the (phred) quality of reads generating the polymorphism.
